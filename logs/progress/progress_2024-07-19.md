# App Progress Log

## Date: 2024-07-19

### Overview
Significant progress was made today, primarily focusing on expanding the application's features, implementing core infrastructure like API routing and theme management, and addressing several runtime errors. The application structure has been substantially built out with new analytics sections and utility pages.

### Features Implemented / Major Changes:
- **Error Fixes:**
    - Resolved Recharts import issues (`Element type is invalid` and `Super expression must either be null or a function`) by ensuring correct imports and moving chart components to client-side rendering.
- **New Page Scaffolding:**
    - Created placeholder pages and sidebar navigation for:
        - Tactical Insights (Offensive, Defensive, Build-Up, Turnover, Set Pieces)
        - Positional Analysis (Role Analysis, Zone Analysis)
        - Match-Up Analysis (Opposition Analysis, Benchmarks)
        - Player Analysis (Profile, Performance Metrics, Heatmaps, Trends, Percentiles)
- **Feature Integration:**
    - Integrated Shot Map functionality into "Tactical Insights > Offensive Phase," removing the standalone page from the sidebar.
- **UI Enhancements:**
    - Added subtle data/football themed background animations to `globals.css`.
    - Implemented Dark Theme switching with localStorage persistence via a `ThemeProvider`.
- **New Core Pages:**
    - **Settings Page:** Basic structure created for app settings.
    - **Profile Page:** Placeholder for user profile management.
    - **Developer Section:**
        - Implemented client-side authentication (admin/admin).
        - Added "App Integrity Checks" for API endpoints, environment variables, and data service, displaying results and metrics.
        - Displays current `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`.
- **API & Data Infrastructure:**
    - Established Next.js API routes (`/api/*`) to serve mock data (simulating backend interaction).
    - Created a `data-service.ts` for environment-aware data fetching (TEST vs. DEV/QUAL/PROD).
    - Updated components to use the new data service.
    - Configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for server-side API calls.
- **Logging Setup:**
    - Created a `logs/progress/PROGRESS_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` for future progress tracking.

### Milestones Reached:
- Core page structure for all major analytics sections established.
- Dark theme and basic user settings functionality implemented.
- Initial developer monitoring tools (integrity checks) in place.
- Robust data fetching layer (`data-service.ts`) that distinguishes between TEST and other environments created.
- Application environment successfully configured to "TEST".

### Current Blockers / Challenges:
- None explicitly identified in this session. The next major steps will involve significant data processing and visualization implementation for all the new pages.

### Next Steps / Goals for Next Session:
- Begin implementing actual data fetching and visualization for one of the new analytics sub-pages (e.g., "Tactical Insights > Offensive Phase" shot map).
- Refine the data models in `mock-data.ts` if needed to support the new visualizations.
- Start implementing the selection mechanisms (e.g., team, player, match dropdowns) on relevant pages.

### Notes / Observations:
- The application's architecture is now more robust with dedicated API routes and a data service layer.
- The Developer Section provides a useful, albeit basic, tool for quick health checks.
- The UI is becoming more dynamic with theming and animations.
